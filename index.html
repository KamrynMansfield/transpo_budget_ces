In a city known for its high cost of living, strategic financial planning becomes essential. Spending should be managed with a focus on balancing immediate needs and lifestyle desires, without compromising the ability to save. Savings act as a safety net for unforeseen circumstances and provide a foundation for future financial goals, such as purchasing a home or planning for a family. Investment, on the other hand, is crucial for wealth growth and inflation-beating returns, helping these couples to build a robust financial portfolio that can support their long-term objectives, including retirement planning. Together, these financial strategies enable non-DINK couples in Mumbai to navigate the city’s economic challenges while working towards achieving their personal and shared dreams. The study is focused on understanding importance of spending pattern for their children education and needs of their childhood. Primary data is collected from 110 families marries non-DINK couples.

Although scholars have suggested similar important gaps by race and ethnicity, these have not been as clearly documented, and some suggest that they may be the result of economic differences or family characteristics. Using 16 years of the Consumer Expenditure Survey, the author shows the predicted levels of parental investments for white, Black, and Hispanic families under four conditions: the unadjusted levels, controlling for family characteristics, controlling for family income, and controlling for both family characteristics and income. The visualization shows large gaps between children in white families compared with Black and Hispanic families. Both sociodemographic and economic factors play a substantial role in these differences, and the racial and ethnic gaps in parental investments of money are nearly eliminated when both are accounted for.;,citation_author=Orestes P.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=An empirical analysis of children’s after school out-of-home activity-location engagement patterns and time allocation;,citation_abstract=Children are an often overlooked and understudied population group, whose travel needs are responsible for a significant number of trips made by a household. In addition, children’s travel and activity participation during the post-school period have direct implication for adults’ activity-travel patterns. A better understanding of children’s after school activity-travel patterns and the linkages between parents and children’s activity-travel needs is necessary for accurate prediction and forecasting of activity-based travel demand modeling systems. In this paper, data from the 2002 Child Development Supplement (CDS) of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) is used to undertake a comprehensive assessment of the post-school out-of-home activitylocation engagement patterns of children aged 5 to 17 years. Specifically, this research effort utilizes a multinomial logit model to analyze children’s post-school location patterns, and employs a multiple discrete-continuous extreme value (MDCEV) model to study the propensity of children to participate in, and allocate time to, multiple activity episode purpose-location types during the after-school period. The results show that a wide variety of demographic, attitudinal, environmental, and others’ activity-travel pattern characteristics impact children’s after school activity engagement patterns.;,citation_author=Rajesh Paleti;,citation_author=Rachel B.

Data and methods used in calculating annual child-rearing expenses are described. Estimates are provided for married-couple and single-parent families with two children for major components of the budget by age of child, family income, and region of residence. For the overall United States, annual child-rearing expense estimates ranged between $12,350 and $13,900 for a child in a two-child, married-couple family in the middle-income group. Adjustment factors for households with less than or greater than two children are also provided. Expenses vary considerably by household income level, region, and composition, emphasizing that a single estimate may not be applicable to all families.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A New Approach to Understanding the Impact of Automobile Ownership on Transportation Equity;,citation_abstract=Transportation affordability, the ability of a household to comfortably bear necessary transportation expenses, is a pressing challenge to the development of sustainable and equitable places. Transportation planners have historically identified transit user groups as choice riders, those with access to other modes or the ability to purchase access, and captive riders, transit-dependent populations who must use transit regardless of service quality. However, this characterization is incomplete, disregarding built-environment pressures that compel a much larger population of households to own and use vehicles regardless of their ability to afford the very high price of vehicle ownership. We propose a new theoretical construct, illuminated using the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Expenditure Survey Public Use Microdata—the transportation choice/captivity matrix—which examines transportation user groups via vehicle ownership and income variables.;,citation_author=Quinn Molloy;,citation_author=Norman Garrick;,citation_author=Carol Atkinson-Palombo;,citation_publication_date=2024-02;,citation_cover_date=2024-02;,citation_year=2024;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://doi.org/10.1177/03611981231174444;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1177/03611981231174444;,citation_issn=0361-1981;,citation_volume=2678;,citation_journal_title=Transportation Research Record;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Relationships between density, transit, and household expenditures in small urban areas;,citation_abstract=This study developed three models to estimate the relationships between density, transit ridership, and household expenditures, with a focus on small urban areas. First, a regression model was developed that estimated transit ridership in small urban areas as a function of service quantity, service characteristics, the unemployment rate, demographic characteristics, and population density. A three-stage least squares estimation model was used to account for the simultaneity between ridership and service quantity. A second model, using American Community Survey data at the Census block group level, estimated the relationships between density and use of transit for commuting, as well as the impacts of living or working in the metro area’s principal city on commuting behavior. Lastly, data from the U.S. Consumer Expenditure Survey were used to model relationships between dwelling type and age with household transportation expenditures. Density was shown to be positively associated with transit ridership. The estimated elasticity is 0.09. The use of transit for commuting was found to increase with block group density, total metro population, if the area is within the principal city, and if a large percentage of workers commute to the principal city. Household transportation expenditures were found to be greater for those living in single-family detached structures and lowest for those living in high rises. Among households living in single-family detached structures, those in older homes were found to spend less on transportation. Older homes tend to be in neighborhoods that are more accessible by walking, biking, and transit.;,citation_author=Jeremy Mattson;,citation_publication_date=2020-11;,citation_cover_date=2020-11;,citation_year=2020;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301718;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.trip.2020.100260;,citation_issn=2590-1982;,citation_volume=8;,citation_journal_title=Transportation Research Interdisciplinary Perspectives;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Relationship between Households’ Housing and Transportation Expenditures: Examination from Lifestyle Perspective;,citation_abstract=Because of growing concern about the significant increase in American household transportation costs, federal agencies have endorsed the notion that it is not merely the affordability of housing alone that is important but the affordability of housing and transportation taken together. Most transportation studies have focused on the relationship between the costs of housing and commuting. Thus the relationship between household expenditures on housing and overall transportation has remained mostly unexamined. With the use of U.S. Consumer Expenditure Survey data, this study made an effort to bridge the gap in the existing knowledge base through an examination of this relationship. In the absence of theories about the relationship between the two types of expenditures, this study leaned heavily on a stream of literature on lifestyle choice, which was advanced to explain the absence of a trade-off between the costs of housing and commuting postulated by urban economic theorists. To account for endogeneity between household expenditures on housing and transportation, three-stage least-squares models were used with the two types of expenditures defined in dollar amounts and as shares of income. For the sake of comparison, a third model, which defined the two types of expenditures as shares of household total expenditures, was used. The relationship between the two types of expenditures varied depending on the definition used. In addition, the models showed the way in which dwelling type, building age, number of household automobiles, public transit use, and metropolitan area size affected transportation expenditure. The implications are discussed.;,citation_author=Devajyoti Deka;,citation_publication_date=2015-01;,citation_cover_date=2015-01;,citation_year=2015;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://doi.org/10.3141/2531-04;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.3141/2531-04;,citation_issn=0361-1981;,citation_volume=2531;,citation_journal_title=Transportation Research Record;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A comprehensive analysis of household transportation expenditures relative to other goods and services: An application to United States consumer expenditure data;,citation_abstract=This paper proposes a multiple discrete continuous nested extreme value (MDCNEV) model to analyze household expenditures for transportation-related items in relation to a host of other consumption categories. The model system presented in this paper is capable of providing a comprehensive assessment of how household consumption patterns (including savings) would be impacted by increases in fuel prices or any other household expense. The MDCNEV model presented in this paper is estimated on disaggregate consumption data from the 2002 Consumer Expenditure Survey data of the United States. Model estimation results show that a host of household and personal socio-economic, demographic, and location variables affect the proportion of monetary resources that households allocate to various consumption categories. Sensitivity analysis conducted using the model demonstrates the applicability of the model for quantifying consumption adjustment patterns in response to rising fuel prices. It is found that households adjust their food consumption, vehicular purchases, and savings rates in the short run. In the long term, adjustments are also made to housing choices (expenses), calling for the need to ensure that fuel price effects are adequately reﬂected in integrated microsimulation models of land use and travel.;,citation_author=Nazneen Ferdous;,citation_author=Abdul Rawoof Pinjari;,citation_author=Chandra R.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Analysis of Variations in Vehicle Ownership Expenditures;,citation_abstract=There is significant concern about the high cost of vehicle ownership, although several authors have acknowledged in the literature that owning and operating a vehicle have accessibility benefits. This paper uses Consumer Expenditure Survey data to explore vehicle ownership expenditures of American households. Differences in vehicle ownership expenditures among urban and rural households are estimated in different regions of the United States, controlling for socioeconomic, demographic, life cycle, and other household factors. First, patterns in vehicle ownership expenses are examined over a year. Three models of expenditures for vehicle ownership are estimated: the first model is estimated by ordinary least squares, the second is a Tobit model estimated to take into account zero expenditures on vehicles by a segment of households during the survey year, and the third model is a two-stage sample selection model that explicitly models first the household vehicle ownership decision and then, given that first decision, the expenditure intensity decision for the subsample of households that own vehicles. It was found that locational and regional effects were not constant but that urban–rural differences depended on region, and differences among regions depended on whether a household was located in an urban or a rural area.;,citation_author=Piyushimita (Vonu) Thakuriah;,citation_author=Yihua Liao;,citation_publication_date=2005-01;,citation_cover_date=2005-01;,citation_year=2005;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0361198105192600101;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1177/0361198105192600101;,citation_issn=0361-1981, 2169-4052;,citation_volume=1926;,citation_journal_title=Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Investigating the effects of ridesourcing on the dynamics of household car ownership;,citation_abstract=Car ownership influences car use, but the emergence of ridesourcing has reshaped this dynamic. The emergence of ridesourcing presents a dual possibility regarding car ownership: it can reduce the need for private car ownership by providing a viable alternative, or it can encourage car ownership by providing an opportunity to earn extra income through ridesourcing. Using the United Kingdom Household Longitudinal Study dataset from 2009 to 2019, this study examines how ridesourcing affects the changes in household car ownership. After controlling for various factors, our results suggest that households are less likely to acquire a car in the presence of ridesourcing while car disposal decisions are mainly driven by household composition and residential relocation factors. We also examine the heterogeneous effects that vary by different numbers of household cars and residential areas. Our results can inform transport authorities and policymakers when planning a sustainable transport system with reduced car dependency.;,citation_author=Pinar Bilgin;,citation_author=Giulio Mattioli;,citation_author=Malcolm Morgan;,citation_author=Zia Wadud;,citation_publication_date=2025-09;,citation_cover_date=2025-09;,citation_year=2025;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361920925002962;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.trd.2025.104886;,citation_issn=1361-9209;,citation_volume=146;,citation_journal_title=Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment;">

Research in this field is particularly timely given many in the millennial generation, a comparably large cohort, are approaching this life stage. This comprehensive literature review develops a framework of factors influencing travel mode choice among families with young children. The findings reveal a multitude of factors influence decisions about mode choice, and, in particular, encourage travel by car, when travelling with young children. The paper concludes with an agenda for future research about travel among families with young children, a largely overlooked group of transport users.;,citation_author=Laura McCarthy;,citation_author=Alexa Delbosc;,citation_author=Graham Currie;,citation_author=Andrew Molloy;,citation_publication_date=2017-11;,citation_cover_date=2017-11;,citation_year=2017;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://doi.org/10.1080/01441647.2017.1354942;,citation_issue=6;,citation_doi=10.1080/01441647.2017.1354942;,citation_issn=0144-1647;,citation_volume=37;,citation_journal_title=Transport Reviews;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The role of household modality style in first and last mile travel mode choice;,citation_abstract=In the context of public transport, the first and last mile (FLM) travel refers to access to or egress from public transport stations. The poor connection between trip origins and destinations impedes the transition towards sustainable transport by requiring commuters to initially use their cars to travel the FLM. Existing literature identifies that the built and natural environment characteristics influence the travel mode choice for FLM travel. However, this literature has yet to consider how individual FLM travel mode choices are influenced by other household members, i.e., intra-household interactions. Here, this study draws on the notion of household modality style (i.e., reflecting heterogeneity in group decision-making) to account for intra-household interactions in FLM travel mode choice. For broadening the understanding of intra-household interactions, the decision of joint travel is also considered in the current study when understanding FLM travel mode choice. By defining the latent class structure at the household level using a household travel survey for Brisbane, Australia, the latent class nested logit models identify two household modality styles: (1) car-oriented; and (2) multimodal. When considering the decision of joint travel, each household modality style group has a specific preference towards FLM travel time, public transport accessibility, station density, and road network intersection density. These findings provide evidence for policymakers aiming to develop transport integration policies targeting specific household types. The results also have implications in practice through prioritisations of distinct household modality styles more likely to shift towards sustainable transport modes.;,citation_author=Ying Lu;,citation_author=Carlo G.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Estimating Transportation Costs by Characteristics of Neighborhood and Household;,citation_abstract=Since information on U.S. household expenditures was first collected, transport expenditures have risen from the sixth-highest share of household budgets, less than 2%, in 1917 to the second-highest share since the 1970s. This rise is linked to increased automobile purchase and automobile use and a relative decline in other costs, particularly food. Studies have also linked variations in the built environment to transport expenditures, but this influence cannot be tested by the federal Consumer Expenditure Survey since it is reported at the metropolitan level. Regional travel demand models recognize the dual influence of land use and household characteristics but do not include sufficient detail on the built environment of neighborhoods. Additionally, these models report travel time, distance, and frequency but not out-of-pocket household transportation expenditures. A study was launched to create a statistical model to predict household total annual transportation expenditures for each neighborhood in the largest metropolitan regions in the United States, controlling for the built environment and household size and income. The model specifies five independent variables—density, jobs access, neighborhood services, walkability, and transit connectivity. Model parameters were calibrated to measured vehicle ownership and transit use in the pilot region, Minneapolis–St. Paul, Minnesota, and to vehicle miles traveled by households at the block group level in the National Household Travel Survey. Statistically significant results confirm the influence of the built environment and regional accessibility on transport expenditures.

The family expenditure perspective is peculiarly appropriate to the examination of the social impacts of transport changes from both operational and construction standpoints: transport is a derived demand, and the examination of the patterns of constraints and revealed preferences for transport in competition with other goods in a household budget has been shown to have a clear and helpful revelance to questions of acces, mobility, and differential impacts of transport changes.

Across the FLC, families maximize their utility through different allocations of resources among leisure travel goods and services as shown by the results of this study. Marrieds without children are more likely to spend on leisure travel than singles, whereas single parents and solitary survivors are less likely to spend on leisure travel than singles. Moreover, Marrieds without children, full nesters II, and empty nesters spend significantly more than singles, whereas solitary survivors spend significantly less on leisure travel. Constraint factors (time and money) and various sociodemographic characteristics are significantly associated with the likelihood of spending on leisure travel and total expenditures.

Several classification schemes for expenditure categories were used, from the most aggregate [two categories (transportation and communications)] to the most disaggregate [nine transportation categories (new vehicle purchases, used vehicle purchases, vehicle finance charges, gasoline and motor oil, vehicle maintenance and repairs, vehicle insurance, public transportation, out-of-town lodging, and other entertainment including bikes and recreational vehicles) and five communications categories (telephone service; miscellaneous household equipment including phones and computers; television, radio, and sound equipment; postage and stationery; and reading)]. Aggregate demand system modeling (in particular, the linear approximate almost ideal demand system) was then used to determine the relationships between expenditures on transportation and those on communications, again for several different classifications. The model results indicate that transportation and communications categories have substitution and complementarity relationships, often not symmetric. However, a dominant effect of complementarity can be found in the influence of communications on transportation.;,citation_author=Sangho Choo;,citation_author=Taihyeong Lee;,citation_author=Patricia L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Transportation Expenditures and Ability to Pay: Evidence from Consumer Expenditure Survey;,citation_abstract=Data at several levels of aggregation and spatial resolution show that mobility (measured by different outcomes such as vehicle miles traveled and automobile ownership) increases with income. It is equally likely that, in turn, investments in mobility (purchase and operation of private automobiles, consumption of public transportation services) allow greater quality of life in general and the ability to increase one’s income. This possibly circular relationship is explored by using the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX) data set. Single-equation Tobit models of annual household transportation expenditures are posited with, in the first case, annual before-tax income and, in the second case, annual total household-level expenditures as a proxy for permanent income. With a variety of demographic, community and spatial, economic, family, and life-cycle conditions of the household controlled, it is found that permanent incomes explain mobility investments better than annual incomes. However, mobility investments and ability to pay are likely to be endogenous since it seems that a greater investment in mobility would lead to positive economic outcomes such as the ability to travel to distant but higher-paying jobs, better and more productive integration of social and household activities into one’s work life, and flexibility in job search and ability to change employers to obtain higher wages and benefits without having to make residential location changes. This potential reverse causality is explored by means of a two-stage model in which the censored mobility investment variable and the household’s ability to pay are jointly modeled.;,citation_author=Piyushimita Thakuriah (Vonu);,citation_author=Yihua Liao;,citation_publication_date=2006-01;,citation_cover_date=2006-01;,citation_year=2006;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0361198106198500128;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1177/0361198106198500128;,citation_issn=0361-1981;,citation_volume=1985;,citation_journal_title=Transportation Research Record;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The value of car ownership and use in the United States;,citation_abstract=It is widely accepted that consumers underestimate the full cost of car ownership and that correcting this bias could meaningfully accelerate the adoption of shared mobility. Yet this argument fails to consider how much benefit consumers enjoy from owning their own vehicle. Here we estimate the value of private car ownership and use in four US metro areas—Chicago, Illinois; Dallas, Texas; Seattle, Washington; and Washington DC—using online discrete choice experiments. We find that, on average, people would need to be paid $11,197 to give up access to their privately owned vehicle for one year, which is at least as much as estimates of the average total private cost of vehicle ownership (~$9,000). Critically, we find that more than half of this value is non-use value—such as the option to travel whenever or wherever needed at a moment’s notice and the status that comes from owning one’s own vehicle—beyond the use value of getting from A to B. Further, this non-use value was found to be much higher during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings reframe the conversation around the transition away from private vehicle dependence, emphasizing the need to provide value and convenience if alternative mobility solutions are to be widely adopted.;,citation_author=Joanna Moody;,citation_author=Elizabeth Farr;,citation_author=Marisa Papagelis;,citation_author=David R.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A review of the socio-demographic characteristics affecting the demand for different car-sharing operational schemes;,citation_abstract=In this paper, socio-demographic factors influencing the demand for different car-sharing forms are examined. An in-depth review of such factors is provided based on the type of shared car service, geographic area, and specific travel demand aspect being considered. Conclusions highlight the differences between car sharing operational schemes. The number of males, young individuals, and people with above-average income among free-floating members is higher than in other car-sharing services. Also, although round-trip car-sharing users appear to be less educated than other car-sharing services users, car-sharing members may follow a more efficient and sustainable lifestyle than the one-way shared car system members. Besides, some suggestions are recommended for future studies. A research gap has been identified regarding the direction of causation between vehicle ownership levels and car-sharing demand. Most studies have worked on the impact of vehicle ownership on car-sharing or simply noted a correlation between the two. However, clarifying any reverse effect would help in better assessing the sustainability of car-sharing services.

Under conditions generally encountered in practice, it is found that the regression coefficient estimators so obtained are at least asymptotically more efficient than those obtained by an equation-by-equation application of least squares. This gain in efficiency can be quite large if “independent” variables in different equations are not highly correlated and if disturbance terms in different equations are highly correlated. Further, tests of the hypothesis that all regression equation coefficient vectors are equal, based on “micro” and “macro” data, are described. If this hypothesis is accepted, there will be no aggregation bias.

Annual budget shares for apparel, housing, and home furnishings are used for measuring status consumption. Results show that Asian American households allocate more of their budget to housing, while African American more to apparel, compared to European households.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Impact of Life-Course Events on Car Ownership;,citation_abstract=This study focuses on the impact of life-course events on car ownership and, ultimately, on travel behavior to provide a basis for measures influencing people toward a more sustainable mobility. The theoretical background for the analysis is the mobility biographies approach. This approach assumes that travel behavior is mainly habitual, and therefore, only relatively seldom do windows of opportunity open for behavioral changes when travel decisions are considered more intensively. Car ownership is used in the analysis as a proxy for actual travel behavior. Hence, the results may deliver some insight on the effect of key events in a person’s or household’s life on travel behavior and, further, the potential of soft policy intervention measures to change daily mobility. The German Socioeconomic Panel is used for the empirical analysis. The results show the importance of life-course events for travel behavior. Besides the household status variables of age, number of cars, and weighted monthly income, four key events have a strong impact on car ownership growth: the changing number of adults in a household, birth of the first child, changing weighted monthly income, and change of residence from a regional core to a regional core area.

The step from two adults towards a family with two adults and one child brings along a lot of consequences. The effects are related to changes in time use, changes in the work situation, differences in composition and size of social networks. Notwithstanding the fact that this key event is quite well studied in the past, the effects on parents’ travel behavior are not. In this paper we found prove for the hypothesis that the arrival of a child affects parents’ travel behavior. Evidence for the hypothesis is found using a large travel behavior study, where differences in trip making, number of trips and distance traveled are considered. Not only the presence of children has an effect, it was also found that the age of the (youngest) child influences parents’ travel behavior strongly and this up to the age of 16 years. Moreover, the influence on parents’ travel is different for mothers and fathers: in particular mothers take care for the transportation of the children. Secondly, from an exploratory study with couples before and after childbirth, the differences between men and women point out that women become some kind of “taxi driver” of the child, even shortly after birth.;,citation_author=Enid Zwerts;,citation_author=Davy Janssens;,citation_author=Geert Wets;,citation_publication_date=2010-02;,citation_cover_date=2010-02;,citation_year=2010;">

<section id="introduction" class="level2" data-number="1">
<h2 data-number="1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>Households juggle how to allocate their budgets: whether to invest in a reliable car, pay for quality childcare, secure housing in a good school district, or set money aside for leisure. These everyday choices shape how families live and move, reflecting the trade-offs they make to balance competing priorities. Transportation often sits at the center of these decisions, not only because it can be a significant expense, but also because choosing to buy and maintain a car versus relying on public transit represents a long-term commitment and a broader lifestyle choice. Its relative weight compared to housing, childcare, and other spending varies widely across families. The relationship between household budgeting and mobility is shaped not only by causal direction but also by how families prioritize and weight different needs. On one hand, mobility resources such as car ownership can structure the household budget: households with no or only one vehicle may spend far less on transportation, freeing up income for other essential or discretionary categories. On the other hand, underlying family structures and preferences can drive budget allocation choipces that, in turn, shape transportation behavior. Larger families may prioritize childcare or invest in higher-quality housing in areas with better schools, limiting what remains for transportation. Others may emphasize frugality across all categories or deliberately substitute toward lower-cost transit options. Understanding both the direction of influence and the weight assigned to different budget categories is critical for transportation planning and policy, as these dynamics reveal how families navigate competing priorities under varying demographic and mobility contexts.</p>
<p>The purpose of this research is to explore how household budgets are structured around transportation decisions and how this impacts other spending categories. Using the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX), we will perform a Latent Class Analysis (LCA) to find groupings based on a household’s transportation expenses. These groupings can help us find groups of spenders with similar patterns to help us predict transportation expenses based on the household’s characteristics.</p>

<p>The literature relating to this study has been classified into four groups: (1) Family Choices and Activity Patterns, (2) Family Transportation Choices, (3) Family Spending and Budgets, and (4) Family Transportation Budgets. The following sections describe the relevant findings from literature in each of these groups.</p>
<section id="family-choices-and-activity-patterns" class="level3" data-number="2.1">
<h3 data-number="2.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="family-choices-and-activity-patterns"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Family Choices and Activity Patterns</h3>
<p>There have been many studies done on the choices and activities of families <span class="citation" data-cites="sener_analysis_2007 copperman_exploratory_2007 sener_analysis_2008 leung_environment-people_2019">(see <a href="#ref-sener_analysis_2007" role="doc-biblioref">Sener and Bhat 2007</a>; <a href="#ref-copperman_exploratory_2007" role="doc-biblioref">Rachel B. Copperman and Bhat 2007b</a>; <a href="#ref-sener_analysis_2008" role="doc-biblioref">Sener et al. 2008</a>; <a href="#ref-leung_environment-people_2019" role="doc-biblioref">Leung et al. 2019</a>)</span>. These studies often focus on the activities choices of households and children.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="paleti_empirical_2011">Paleti, Copperman, and Bhat (<a href="#ref-paleti_empirical_2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span> performed a study where they wanted to characterize the activity patterns of children after school. Their data were gathered from the Child Development Supplement to the Panel Study of Income Dynamics which has household demographics and time-use diaries for children. They looked at travel patterns using combinations of three activity-travel scenarios: staying at school, going home from school, and going somewhere else after school. They further identified specific after-school activities (e.g.&nbsp;Organized activities at school, recreation at the home of someone else, meals at restaurants, etc.) to use in a multiple discrete-continuous extreme value (MDCEV) model. The MDCEV is a type of discrete choice model that works when multiple options can be chosen, and was used to find predictors of children’s participation in the different after school activities. In their analysis, they found that 57.7% of children in the survey participated in at least one out-of-home activity after school. They also found that children’s activities were connected to household income, family dynamics, environment, and other things. For example, children in households with higher income were more likely to participate in activities after school. Children with no siblings along with children having a working primary caregiver were more likely to stay at school or go somewhere besides home directly after school. Children living close to a large city were less likely to go somewhere after school, go home, and then go back out. The findings of this study show the variety of factors that might affect a family’s activity, and therefore transportation, patterns.</p>
<p>Another study on family choices was done by <span class="citation" data-cites="bernardo_empirical_2015">Bernardo et al. (<a href="#ref-bernardo_empirical_2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>. They used the American Time Use Survey and a Multiple Discrete Continuous Nested Extreme Value (MDCNEV) model to examine the activities of duel-earner households. The variables they used relate to household demographics, respondent demographics, couple characteristics, and day of the week. Findings indicated that women are more likely to participate in out-of-home maintenance, shopping, and social activities than men. They also found that respondents with higher education and with children are more likely to work from home. One key finding of this study is that couples with children are much less likely to participate in out-of-home, non-work activities.</p>

<h3 data-number="2.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="family-transportation-choices"><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Family Transportation Choices</h3>
<p>Among the studies on family choices is a group of studies that focus on family transportation choices <span class="citation" data-cites="copperman_analysis_2007 souche_measuring_2010 lu_role_2022 amirnazmiafshar_review_2022">(<a href="#ref-copperman_analysis_2007" role="doc-biblioref">Rachel B.

These studies look at the connection between family mobility and family decisions.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="mccarthy_factors_2017">McCarthy et al. (<a href="#ref-mccarthy_factors_2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span> is a literature review with some good findings, but I don’t know if I should site the literature review or if I should find individual papers from the review to talk about.</p>
<p>A unique study to understand the effects car ownership has on household decisions was done by Nicholas <span class="citation" data-cites="klein_subsidizing_2024">Klein (<a href="#ref-klein_subsidizing_2024" role="doc-biblioref">2024</a>)</span>. In order to understand how access to a car can effect a family in the United States, he interviewed 30 people in Maryland and Virginia who received a subsidized car. Two main findings of this study relate to travel behavior changes and access to opportunities. The people interviewed generally changed their travel behavior in similar ways after receiving a car. Before receiving the car, they would rely on public transit and others for transportation, but after receiving a car, they made many trips in their own cars, including some trips that they had to forgo before having a car. Another general conclusion Klein makes is that people had more access to opportunities after receiving a car. They had easier access to more potential jobs, but some also mentioned the ability to get more hours at the their current jobs. With less reliance on public transit, many respondents spent more time with their families at the beginning and end of the day.</p>
<p>Another study interested in car ownership was done by @bilgin_investigating_2025. They analyzed car ownership across multiple years using the United Kingdom Household Longitudinal Study dataset to see if ridesourcing availability affects car ownership. They used two fixed effects logit models: one to model the effect of ridesourcing on the decision to increase the number of cars in the household and the other to model the effect of ridesourcing on the decision to decrease the number of cars in the household. Their results suggested that households with more than one car are more likely to get rid of a car and less likely to add a car compared to households with one car. Even with this tendency, their models did not show a strong connection between the presence of ride sourcing and changes in car ownership. They concluded that changes in household composition have a stronger impact on the change in number of cars of a household.</p>

<h3 data-number="2.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="family-spending-and-budgets"><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Family Spending and Budgets</h3>
<p>Another set of studies focuses on household budgets and household spending patterns <span class="citation" data-cites="skinner_variable_1985 nayga_sample_1998 fontes_effects_2006 sabelhaus_is_2013">(<a href="#ref-skinner_variable_1985" role="doc-biblioref">Skinner 1985</a>; <a href="#ref-nayga_sample_1998" role="doc-biblioref">Nayga 1998</a>; <a href="#ref-fontes_effects_2006" role="doc-biblioref">Fontes and Fan 2006</a>; <a href="#ref-sabelhaus_is_2013" role="doc-biblioref">Sabelhaus et al. 2013</a>)</span>. Many of the studies reviewed had an emphasis on the budgets related to raising children. <span class="citation" data-cites="hargunani_study_2024">Hargunani, Vernekar, and Vernekar (<a href="#ref-hargunani_study_2024" role="doc-biblioref">2024</a>)</span> analyzed family spending patterns in Mumbai and concluded that many families focus their expenditures on the current and future wellbeing of their children. This is evidenced by money spent on basic necessities and setting aside money for the future.</p>
<p>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has produced reports that use the CEX to specifically analyze the costs of raising a child in the United States. The most recent report <span class="citation" data-cites="lino_expenditures_2017">(<a href="#ref-lino_expenditures_2017" role="doc-biblioref">Lino et al. 2017</a>)</span> found the top expenditure for married-couple families with two children to be housing. The rankings of other expenditures were different depending on the age of children, but food, child care/education, and transportation were always the next highest expenditures on children. Similar to the USDA report on the cost of raising children, <span class="citation" data-cites="osborne_updated_2021">Osborne, Wu, and Benson (<a href="#ref-osborne_updated_2021" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span> modeled the cost of raising children in Texas by following similar methodologies but using Texas-specific data for housing and childcare costs. They looked not only at married-couple families, but also at single-parent households and duel households where children spend time with both parents in different locations. They found differing expenditures on children among the different family make-ups and among different incomes.</p>
<p>Other studies with similar analyses have had similar findings. @hastings_parental_2022 used the CEX to compare expenditures between different racial and ethnic groups. When controlling for both family characteristics and income, he found that there was not a significant difference in total expenditures on children among racial and ethnic groups. This suggests that income and family characteristics play a larger role in family budgeting than race and ethnicity. <span class="citation" data-cites="duncan_estimating_2023">Duncan, Frank, and Guèvremont (<a href="#ref-duncan_estimating_2023" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a>)</span> performed a study in Canada using the country’s Survey of Household Spending (SHS) to analyze family expenditures. They found similar results as previously mentioned studies. Different income groups had different amounts allocated to children, but housing was always the highest expenditure with food, child care/education, and transportation being the next highest expenditures.</p>

<p>One study focused on transportation budgets was done by <span class="citation" data-cites="thakuriah_analysis_2005">Thakuriah and Liao (<a href="#ref-thakuriah_analysis_2005" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>)</span>. Using CEX data, they made multiple models to analyze the expenditures related to vehicle ownership of households in the United States. In each model, they used a variety of variables (income, household demographics, spatial factors, economic factors, and family condition factors) to predict the amount of money a household spends on vehicles. Their model results indicate 18 percent of additional household expenditures is a vehicle expense. They results also indicate many factors influence household vehicle expenses. The models showed that homeowners spend more on vehicle expenses. They also showed that vehicle expenses are connected with the sex of the head of household and the number of people in the household.</p>
<p>In a study by <span class="citation" data-cites="deka_relationship_2015">Deka (<a href="#ref-deka_relationship_2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>, they used two years of the CEX to see the connection between housing expenses and transportation expenses. They created three least squares models: one to describe expenditures in dollar amounts, one to describe expenditures as percentages of income, and one to describe expenditures as shares of total household expenditures. They found a positive association between transportation expenses and housing expenses. Similarly, share of income on transportation was positively affected by share of income on housing, but there was no significant evidence showing the share of income on housing being affected by share of income on transportation. Both housing and transportation expenditures were found to be higher for those living in single-family detached homes and lower for those living in older homes.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="mattson_relationships_2020">Mattson (<a href="#ref-mattson_relationships_2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="mattson_relationships_2019">Mattson and Peterson (<a href="#ref-mattson_relationships_2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span> - single family homes spend more on transportation, higher income is correlated with higher transportation costs. - denser areas are more likely to use transit to commute.

<p><span class="citation" data-cites="mattson_relationships_2019">Mattson and Peterson (<a href="#ref-mattson_relationships_2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span> looked at how density, land use, transportation, and household expenditures are related. They developed a regression model using CEX data where transportation expenditures were estimated using type of housing, population, family characteristics, and other factors. Similar to other studies, they found that income is positively associated with transportation expenditures. Their model showed single-family homes to have higher transportation expenditures than other types of dwellings. Using data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Annual Survey of State and Local Government Finances, they also created models to explore how land use might affect municipal spending. In these models, increase in density was associated with a decrease in many per capita operational costs, including fire protection, streets and highways, parks and recreation, and others.</p>
<p>A similar study was published by <span class="citation" data-cites="mattson_relationships_2020">Mattson (<a href="#ref-mattson_relationships_2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> where he modeled transportation expenditures using CEX data. The results showed, like the previous publication, that single-family dwellings spend more on transportation compared to other types. He also found that larger household sizes and newer homes contribute to higher transportation spending.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="molloy_new_2024">Molloy, Garrick, and Atkinson-Palombo (<a href="#ref-molloy_new_2024" role="doc-biblioref">2024</a>)</span> - “Captive Riders” have less spending allocated to transportation than captive drivers.</p>
<p>In their study, <span class="citation" data-cites="molloy_new_2024">Molloy, Garrick, and Atkinson-Palombo (<a href="#ref-molloy_new_2024" role="doc-biblioref">2024</a>)</span> look at CEX data through after proposing new framework to look at transit users and vehicle users. In past studies, three categories have been used to analyze transportation users: “drivers” are those who own a car, “captive riders” are those who use transit because they ca not afford a car, and “choice riders” are those who can afford a car but do not. Instead of having one grouping for those that own cars, <span class="citation" data-cites="molloy_new_2024">Molloy, Garrick, and Atkinson-Palombo (<a href="#ref-molloy_new_2024" role="doc-biblioref">2024</a>)</span> propose splitting that category into “captive drivers” and “choice drivers”. Captive drivers would be those in the population that are low income but have a car representing people with less transportation freedom. They analyzed the CEX with this new way of classifying transportation users and found that captive drivers carry the most transportation burden. The transportation expenditures of captive drivers average more than 16% of total household expenditures while the transportation expenditures of captive riders was only around 7% of total expenditures.</p>

<p>Data for the following analysis were attained from the 2024 Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX) Public Use Microdata (PUMD). The CEX is deployed continuously by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The data are organized by quarter published each year. The CEX consists of two surveys as described below.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Interview Survey</strong> tracks a household’s major and recurring expenditures by reviewing their expenses from the past three months. Approximatedly 6000 usable interviews are collected each quarter. After interviewing a household for 4 consecutive quarters, they are removed from the sample and replaced by a new household.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Diary Survey</strong> tracks a household’s weekly expenditures by having them fill out a detailed expenditure diary across a two-week span. Approximately 3000 usable responses are collected each quarter. After the two consecutive weeks of reporting expenditures, the household is removed from the sample and replaced by a new household.</p></li>

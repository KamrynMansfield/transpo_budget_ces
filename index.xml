  <title>1 Introduction</title>
  <p>Households juggle how to allocate their budgets: whether to invest
  in a reliable car, pay for quality childcare, secure housing in a good
  school district, or set money aside for leisure. These everyday
  choices shape how families live and move, reflecting the trade-offs
  they make to balance competing priorities. Transportation often sits
  at the center of these decisions, not only because it can be a
  significant expense, but also because choosing to buy and maintain a
  car versus relying on public transit represents a long-term commitment
  and a broader lifestyle choice. Its relative weight compared to
  housing, childcare, and other spending varies widely across families.
  The relationship between household budgeting and mobility is shaped
  not only by causal direction but also by how families prioritize and
  weight different needs. On one hand, mobility resources such as car
  ownership can structure the household budget: households with no or
  only one vehicle may spend far less on transportation, freeing up
  income for other essential or discretionary categories. On the other
  hand, underlying family structures and preferences can drive budget
  allocation choices that, in turn, shape transportation behavior.
  Larger families may prioritize childcare or invest in higher-quality
  housing in areas with better schools, limiting what remains for
  transportation. Others may emphasize frugality across all categories
  or deliberately substitute toward lower-cost transit options.
  Understanding both the direction of influence and the weight assigned
  to different budget categories is critical for transportation planning
  and policy, as these dynamics reveal how families navigate competing
  priorities under varying demographic and mobility contexts.</p>
  <p>The purpose of this research is to explore how household budgets
  are structured around transportation decisions and how this impacts
  other spending categories. Using the Consumer Expenditure Survey
  (CEX), we will perform a Latent Class Analysis (LCA) to find groupings
  based on a household’s transportation expenses. Theses groupings can
  help us find groups of spenders with similar patterns to help us
  predict transportation expenses based on the household’s
  characteristics.</p>

  <title>2 Literature Review</title>
  <p>The literature relating to this study has be classified into four
  groups: (1) Family Choices and Activity Patterns, (2) Family
  Transportation Choices, (3) Family Spending and Budgets, and (4)
  Family Transportation Budgets. The following sections describe the
  relevant findings from literature in each of these groups.</p>

    <p>There have been many studies done on the choices and activities

    choices of households and children.</p>
    <p>Paleti, Copperman, and Bhat
    (<xref alt="2011" rid="ref-paleti_empirical_2011" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>)
    performed a study where they wanted to characterize the activity
    patterns of children after school. Their data were gathered from the
    Child Development Supplement to the Panel Study of Income Dynamics
    which has household demographics and time-use diaries for children.
    They looked at travel patterns using combinations of three
    activity-travel scenarios: staying at school, going home from
    school, and going somewhere else after school. They further
    identified specific after-school activities (e.g. Organized
    activities at school, recreation at the home of someone else, meals
    at restaurants, etc.) to use in a multiple discrete-continuous
    extreme value (MDCEV) model. The MDCEV is a type of discrete choice
    model that works when multiple options can be chosen, and was used
    to find predictors of children’s participation in the different
    after school activities. In their analysis, they found that 57.7% of
    children in the survey participated in at least one out-of-home
    activity after school. They also found that children’s activities
    were connected to household income, family dynamics, environment,
    and other things. For example, children in households with higher
    income were more likely to participate in activities after school.
    Children with no siblings along with children having a working
    primary caregiver were more likely to stay at school or go somewhere
    besides home directly after school. Children living close to a large
    city were less likely to go somewhere after school, go home, and
    then go back out. The findings of this study show the variety of
    factors that might affect a family’s activity, and therefore
    transportation, patterns.</p>
    <p>Another study on family choices was done by Bernardo et al.
    (<xref alt="2015" rid="ref-bernardo_empirical_2015" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).
    They used the American Time Use Survey and a Multiple Discrete
    Continuous Nested Extreme Value (MDCNEV) model to examine the
    activities of duel-earner households. The variables they used relate
    to household demographics, respondent demographics, couple
    characteristics, and day of the week. Findings indicated that women
    are more likely to participate in out-of-home maintenance, shopping,
    and social activities than men. They also found that respondents
    with higher education and with children are more likely to work from
    home. One key finding of this study is that couples with children
    are much less likely to participate in out-of-home, non-work
    activities.</p>

    <p>McCarthy et al.
    (<xref alt="2017" rid="ref-mccarthy_factors_2017" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>)
    is a literature review with some good findings, but I don’t know if
    I should site the literature review or if I should find individual
    papers from the review to talk about.</p>
    <p>A unique study to understand the effects car ownership has on
    household decisions was done by Nicholas Klein
    (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-klein_subsidizing_2024" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>).
    In order to understand how access to a car can effect a family in
    the United States, he interviewed 30 people in Maryland and Virginia
    who received a subsidized car. Two main findings of this study
    relate to travel behavior changes and access to opportunities. The
    people interviewed generally changed their travel behavior in
    similar ways after receiving a car. Before receiving the car, they
    would rely on public transit and others for transportation, but
    after receiving a car, they made many trips in their own cars,
    including some trips that they had to forgo before having a car.
    Another general conclusion Klein makes is that people had more
    access to opportunities after receiving a car. They had easier
    access to more potential jobs, but some also mentioned the ability
    to get more hours at the their current jobs. With less reliance on
    public transit, many respondents spent more time with their families
    at the beginning and end of the day.</p>
    <p>Another study interested in car ownership was done by
    @bilgin_investigating_2025. They analyzed car ownership across
    multiple years using the United Kingdom Household Longitudinal Study
    dataset to see if ridesourcing availability affects car ownership.
    They used two fixed effects logit models: one to model the effect of
    ridesourcing on the decision to increase the number of cars in the
    household and the other to model the effect of ridesourcing on the
    decision to decrease the number of cars in the household. Their
    results suggested that households with more than one car are more
    likely to get rid of a car and less likely to add a car compared to
    households with one car. Even with this tendency, their models did
    not show a strong connection between the presence of ride sourcing
    and changes in car ownership. They concluded that changes in
    household composition have a stronger impact on the change in number
    of cars of a household.</p>

    the budgets related to raising children. Hargunani, Vernekar, and
    Vernekar
    (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-hargunani_study_2024" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>)
    analyzed family spending patterns in Mumbai and concluded that many
    families focus their expenditures on the current and future
    wellbeing of their children. This is evidenced by money spent on
    basic necessities and setting aside money for the future.</p>
    <p>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has produced
    reports that use the CEX to specifically analyze the costs of
    raising a child in the United States. The most recent report
    (<xref alt="Lino et al. 2017" rid="ref-lino_expenditures_2017" ref-type="bibr">Lino
    et al. 2017</xref>) found the top expenditure for married-couple
    families with two children to be housing. The rankings of other
    expenditures were different depending on the age of children, but
    food, child care/education, and transportation were always the next
    highest expenditures on children. Similar to the USDA report on the
    cost of raising children, Osborne, Wu, and Benson
    (<xref alt="2021" rid="ref-osborne_updated_2021" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>)
    modeled the cost of raising children in Texas by following similar
    methodologies but using Texas-specific data for housing and
    childcare costs. They looked not only at married-couple families,
    but also at single-parent households and duel households where
    children spend time with both parents in different locations. They
    found differing expenditures on children among the different family
    make-ups and among different incomes.</p>
    <p>Other studies with similar analyses have had similar findings.
    @hastings_parental_2022 used the CEX to compare expenditures between
    different racial and ethnic groups. When controlling for both family
    characteristics and income, he found that there was not a
    significant difference in total expenditures on children among
    racial and ethnic groups. This suggests that income and family
    characteristics play a larger role in family budgeting than race and
    ethnicity. Duncan, Frank, and Guèvremont
    (<xref alt="2023" rid="ref-duncan_estimating_2023" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>)
    performed a study in Canada using the country’s Survey of Household
    Spending (SHS) to analyze family expenditures. They found similar
    results as previously mentioned studies. Different income groups had
    different amounts allocated to children, but housing was always the
    highest expenditure with food, child care/education, and
    transportation being the next highest expenditures.</p>

    (<xref alt="2005" rid="ref-thakuriah_analysis_2005" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>).
    Using CEX data, they made multiple models to analyze the
    expenditures related to vehicle ownership of households in the
    United States. In each model, they used a variety of variables
    (income, household demographics, spatial factors, economic factors,
    and family condition factors) to predict the amount of money a
    household spends on vehicles. Their model results indicate 18
    percent of additional household expenditures is a vehicle expense.
    They results also indicate many factors influence household vehicle
    expenses. The models showed that homeowners spend more on vehicle
    expenses. They also showed that vehicle expenses are connected with
    the sex of the head of household and the number of people in the
    household.</p>

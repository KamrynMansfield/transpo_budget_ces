  <p>Households juggle how to allocate their budgets: whether to invest
  in a reliable car, pay for quality childcare, secure housing in a good
  school district, or set money aside for leisure. These everyday
  choices shape how families live and move, reflecting the trade-offs
  they make to balance competing priorities. Transportation often sits
  at the center of these decisions, not only because it can be a
  significant expense, but also because choosing to buy and maintain a
  car versus relying on public transit represents a long-term commitment
  and a broader lifestyle choice. Its relative weight compared to
  housing, childcare, and other spending varies widely across families.
  The relationship between household budgeting and mobility is shaped
  not only by causal direction but also by how families prioritize and
  weight different needs. On one hand, mobility resources such as car
  ownership can structure the household budget: households with no or
  only one vehicle may spend far less on transportation, freeing up
  income for other essential or discretionary categories. On the other
  hand, underlying family structures and preferences can drive budget
  allocation choipces that, in turn, shape transportation behavior.
  Larger families may prioritize childcare or invest in higher-quality
  housing in areas with better schools, limiting what remains for
  transportation. Others may emphasize frugality across all categories
  or deliberately substitute toward lower-cost transit options.
  Understanding both the direction of influence and the weight assigned
  to different budget categories is critical for transportation planning
  and policy, as these dynamics reveal how families navigate competing
  priorities under varying demographic and mobility contexts.</p>
  <p>The purpose of this research is to explore how household budgets
  are structured around transportation decisions and how this impacts
  other spending categories. Using the Consumer Expenditure Survey
  (CEX), we will perform a Latent Class Analysis (LCA) to find groupings
  based on a household’s transportation expenses. These groupings can
  help us find groups of spenders with similar patterns to help us
  predict transportation expenses based on the household’s
  characteristics.</p>

  <p>The literature relating to this study has been classified into four
  groups: (1) Family Choices and Activity Patterns, (2) Family
  Transportation Choices, (3) Family Spending and Budgets, and (4)
  Family Transportation Budgets. The following sections describe the
  relevant findings from literature in each of these groups.</p>
  <sec id="household-activities-and-transportation-choices">
    <title>2.1 Household Activities and Transportation Choices</title>
    <p>The literature shows that household dynamics affect the activity
    patterns of those in the household, and many studies focus on the
    role children play in these household activities. Some studies aim
    to find how the presence of children affect the activities of the
    household
    (<xref alt="Bernardo et al. 2015" rid="ref-bernardo_empirical_2015" ref-type="bibr">Bernardo
    et al. 2015</xref>), and many studies focus on how children’s
    activities are affected by household demographics (see

    <xref alt="Leung et al. 2019" rid="ref-leung_environment-people_2019" ref-type="bibr">Leung
    et al. 2019</xref>). A common finding in these studies is that child
    activity participation is associated with the environment the child
    lives in along with household income, parent activities, and other
    household demographics.</p>
    <p>Among the studies on household choices is a group of literature
    with a specific focus on a household’s transportation decisions. A
    common finding in this group of literature is that household
    composition plays a role in its transportation choices. Some studies
    in this group are concerned with the way households use cars or the
    effect of car ownership on transportation decisions

    the budgets related to raising children. Hargunani, Vernekar, and
    Vernekar
    (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-hargunani_study_2024" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>)
    analyzed family spending patterns in Mumbai and concluded that many
    families focus their expenditures on the current and future
    wellbeing of their children. This is evidenced by money spent on
    basic necessities and setting aside money for the future.</p>
    <p>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has produced
    reports that use the CEX to specifically analyze the costs of
    raising a child in the United States. The most recent report
    (<xref alt="Lino et al. 2017" rid="ref-lino_expenditures_2017" ref-type="bibr">Lino
    et al. 2017</xref>) found the top expenditure for married-couple
    families with two children to be housing. The rankings of other
    expenditures were different depending on the age of children, but
    food, child care/education, and transportation were always the next
    highest expenditures on children. Similar to the USDA report on the
    cost of raising children, Osborne, Wu, and Benson
    (<xref alt="2021" rid="ref-osborne_updated_2021" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>)
    modeled the cost of raising children in Texas by following similar
    methodologies but using Texas-specific data for housing and
    childcare costs. They looked not only at married-couple families,
    but also at single-parent households and duel households where
    children spend time with both parents in different locations. They
    found differing expenditures on children among the different family
    make-ups and among different incomes.</p>
    <p>Duncan, Frank, and Guèvremont
    (<xref alt="2023" rid="ref-duncan_estimating_2023" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>)
    performed a study in Canada using the country’s Survey of Household
    Spending (SHS) to analyze family expenditures. They found similar
    results as previously mentioned studies. Different income groups had
    different amounts allocated to children, but housing was always the
    highest expenditure with food, child care/education, and
    transportation being the next highest expenditures.</p>
    <p>Other studies with similar analyses have had similar findings.
    Hastings
    (<xref alt="2022" rid="ref-hastings_parental_2022" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>)
    used the CEX to compare expenditures between different racial and
    ethnic groups. When controlling for both family characteristics and
    income, he found that there was not a significant difference in
    total expenditures on children among racial and ethnic groups. This
    suggests that income and family characteristics play a larger role
    in family budgeting than race and ethnicity.</p>

    and Liao
    (<xref alt="2005" rid="ref-thakuriah_analysis_2005" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>).
    Using CEX data, they made multiple models to analyze the
    expenditures related to vehicle ownership of households in the
    United States. In each model, they used a variety of variables
    (income, household demographics, spatial factors, economic factors,
    and family condition factors) to predict the amount of money a
    household spends on vehicles. Their model results indicate 18
    percent of additional household expenditures is a vehicle expense.
    They results also indicate many factors influence household vehicle
    expenses. The models showed that homeowners spend more on vehicle
    expenses. They also showed that vehicle expenses are connected with
    the sex of the head of household and the number of people in the
    household.</p>
    <p>In a study by Deka
    (<xref alt="2015" rid="ref-deka_relationship_2015" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>),
    they used two years of the CEX to see the connection between housing
    expenses and transportation expenses. They created three least
    squares models: one to describe expenditures in dollar amounts, one
    to describe expenditures as percentages of income, and one to
    describe expenditures as shares of total household expenditures.
    They found a positive association between transportation expenses
    and housing expenses. Similarly, share of income on transportation
    was positively affected by share of income on housing, but there was
    no significant evidence showing the share of income on housing being
    affected by share of income on transportation. Both housing and
    transportation expenditures were found to be higher for those living
    in single-family detached homes and lower for those living in older
    homes.</p>
    <p>Mattson and Peterson
    (<xref alt="2019" rid="ref-mattson_relationships_2019" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>)
    looked at how density, land use, transportation, and household
    expenditures are related. They developed a regression model using
    CEX data where transportation expenditures were estimated using type
    of housing, population, family characteristics, and other factors.
    Similar to other studies, they found that income is positively
    associated with transportation expenditures. Their model showed
    single-family homes to have higher transportation expenditures than
    other types of dwellings. Using data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s
    Annual Survey of State and Local Government Finances, they also
    created models to explore how land use might affect municipal
    spending. In these models, increase in density was associated with a
    decrease in many per capita operational costs, including fire
    protection, streets and highways, parks and recreation, and
    others.</p>
    <p>A similar study was published by Mattson
    (<xref alt="2020" rid="ref-mattson_relationships_2020" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>)
    where he modeled transportation expenditures using CEX data. The
    results showed, like the previous publication, that single-family
    dwellings spend more on transportation compared to other types. He
    also found that larger household sizes and newer homes contribute to
    higher transportation spending.</p>
    <p>In their study, Molloy, Garrick, and Atkinson-Palombo
    (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-molloy_new_2024" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>)
    look at CEX data after proposing a new framework to look at transit
    users and vehicle users. In past studies, three categories have been
    used to analyze transportation users: “drivers” are those who own a
    car, “captive riders” are those who use transit because they ca not
    afford a car, and “choice riders” are those who can afford a car but
    do not. Instead of having one grouping for those that own cars,
    Molloy, Garrick, and Atkinson-Palombo
    (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-molloy_new_2024" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>)
    propose splitting that category into “captive drivers” and “choice
    drivers”. Captive drivers would be those in the population that are
    low income but have a car representing people with less
    transportation freedom. They analyzed the CEX with this new way of
    classifying transportation users and found that captive drivers
    carry the most transportation burden. The transportation
    expenditures of captive drivers average more than 16% of total
    household expenditures while the transportation expenditures of
    captive riders was only around 7% of total expenditures.</p>

  <p>Households juggle how to allocate their budgets: whether to invest
  in a reliable car, pay for quality childcare, secure housing in a good
  school district, or set money aside for leisure. These everyday
  choices shape how families live and move, reflecting the trade-offs
  they make to balance competing priorities. Transportation often sits
  at the center of these decisions, not only because it can be a
  significant expense, but also because choosing to buy and maintain a
  car versus relying on public transit represents a long-term commitment
  and a broader lifestyle choice. Its relative weight compared to
  housing, childcare, and other spending varies widely across families.
  The relationship between household budgeting and mobility is shaped
  not only by causal direction but also by how families prioritize and
  weight different needs. On one hand, mobility resources such as car
  ownership can structure the household budget: households with no or
  only one vehicle may spend far less on transportation, freeing up
  income for other essential or discretionary categories. On the other
  hand, underlying family structures and preferences can drive budget
  allocation choipces that, in turn, shape transportation behavior.
  Larger families may prioritize childcare or invest in higher-quality
  housing in areas with better schools, limiting what remains for
  transportation. Others may emphasize frugality across all categories
  or deliberately substitute toward lower-cost transit options.
  Understanding both the direction of influence and the weight assigned
  to different budget categories is critical for transportation planning
  and policy, as these dynamics reveal how families navigate competing
  priorities under varying demographic and mobility contexts.</p>
  <p>The purpose of this research is to explore how household budgets
  are structured around transportation decisions and how this impacts
  other spending categories. Using the Consumer Expenditure Survey
  (CEX), we will perform a Latent Class Analysis (LCA) to find groupings
  based on a household’s transportation expenses. These groupings can
  help us find groups of spenders with similar patterns to help us
  predict transportation expenses based on the household’s
  characteristics.</p>

  <p>The literature relating to this study has been classified into four

  Transportation Choices, (3) Family Spending and Budgets, and (4)
  Family Transportation Budgets. The following sections describe the
  relevant findings from literature in each of these groups.</p>
  <sec id="household-activities-and-transportation-choices-nb-article">
    <title>2.1 Household Activities and Transportation Choices</title>
    <p>The literature shows that household dynamics affect the activity
    patterns of those in the household, and many studies focus on the
    role children play in these household activities. Some studies aim
    to find how the presence of children affect the activities of the
    household
    (<xref alt="Bernardo et al. 2015" rid="ref-bernardo_empirical_2015-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Bernardo

    activities are affected by household demographics (see

    activity participation is associated with the environment the child
    lives in along with household income, parent activities, and other
    household demographics.</p>
    <p>Among the studies on household choices is a group of literature
    with a specific focus on a household’s transportation decisions. A
    common finding in this group of literature is that household
    composition plays a role in its transportation choices. Some studies
    in this group are concerned with the way households use cars or the
    effect of car ownership on transportation decisions

    Vernekar
    (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-hargunani_study_2024-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>)
    analyzed family spending patterns in Mumbai and concluded that many
    families focus their expenditures on the current and future
    wellbeing of their children. This is evidenced by money spent on
    basic necessities and setting aside money for the future.</p>
    <p>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has produced
    reports that use the CEX to specifically analyze the costs of
    raising a child in the United States. The most recent report
    (<xref alt="Lino et al. 2017" rid="ref-lino_expenditures_2017-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Lino
    et al. 2017</xref>) found the top expenditure for married-couple
    families with two children to be housing. The rankings of other
    expenditures were different depending on the age of children, but
    food, child care/education, and transportation were always the next
    highest expenditures on children. Similar to the USDA report on the
    cost of raising children, Osborne, Wu, and Benson
    (<xref alt="2021" rid="ref-osborne_updated_2021-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>)
    modeled the cost of raising children in Texas by following similar
    methodologies but using Texas-specific data for housing and
    childcare costs. They looked not only at married-couple families,
    but also at single-parent households and duel households where
    children spend time with both parents in different locations. They
    found differing expenditures on children among the different family
    make-ups and among different incomes.</p>
    <p>Duncan, Frank, and Guèvremont
    (<xref alt="2023" rid="ref-duncan_estimating_2023-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>)
    performed a study in Canada using the country’s Survey of Household
    Spending (SHS) to analyze family expenditures. They found similar
    results as previously mentioned studies. Different income groups had
    different amounts allocated to children, but housing was always the
    highest expenditure with food, child care/education, and
    transportation being the next highest expenditures.</p>
    <p>Other studies with similar analyses have had similar findings.
    Hastings
    (<xref alt="2022" rid="ref-hastings_parental_2022-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>)
    used the CEX to compare expenditures between different racial and
    ethnic groups. When controlling for both family characteristics and
    income, he found that there was not a significant difference in
    total expenditures on children among racial and ethnic groups. This
    suggests that income and family characteristics play a larger role
    in family budgeting than race and ethnicity.</p>

    and Liao
    (<xref alt="2005" rid="ref-thakuriah_analysis_2005-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>).
    Using CEX data, they made multiple models to analyze the
    expenditures related to vehicle ownership of households in the
    United States. In each model, they used a variety of variables
    (income, household demographics, spatial factors, economic factors,
    and family condition factors) to predict the amount of money a
    household spends on vehicles. Their model results indicate 18
    percent of additional household expenditures is a vehicle expense.
    They results also indicate many factors influence household vehicle
    expenses. The models showed that homeowners spend more on vehicle
    expenses. They also showed that vehicle expenses are connected with
    the sex of the head of household and the number of people in the
    household.</p>
    <p>In a study by Deka
    (<xref alt="2015" rid="ref-deka_relationship_2015-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>),
    they used two years of the CEX to see the connection between housing
    expenses and transportation expenses. They created three least
    squares models: one to describe expenditures in dollar amounts, one
    to describe expenditures as percentages of income, and one to
    describe expenditures as shares of total household expenditures.
    They found a positive association between transportation expenses
    and housing expenses. Similarly, share of income on transportation
    was positively affected by share of income on housing, but there was
    no significant evidence showing the share of income on housing being
    affected by share of income on transportation. Both housing and
    transportation expenditures were found to be higher for those living
    in single-family detached homes and lower for those living in older
    homes.</p>
    <p>Mattson and Peterson
    (<xref alt="2019" rid="ref-mattson_relationships_2019-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>)
    looked at how density, land use, transportation, and household
    expenditures are related. They developed a regression model using
    CEX data where transportation expenditures were estimated using type
    of housing, population, family characteristics, and other factors.
    Similar to other studies, they found that income is positively
    associated with transportation expenditures. Their model showed
    single-family homes to have higher transportation expenditures than
    other types of dwellings. Using data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s
    Annual Survey of State and Local Government Finances, they also
    created models to explore how land use might affect municipal
    spending. In these models, increase in density was associated with a
    decrease in many per capita operational costs, including fire
    protection, streets and highways, parks and recreation, and
    others.</p>
    <p>A similar study was published by Mattson
    (<xref alt="2020" rid="ref-mattson_relationships_2020-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>)
    where he modeled transportation expenditures using CEX data. The
    results showed, like the previous publication, that single-family
    dwellings spend more on transportation compared to other types. He
    also found that larger household sizes and newer homes contribute to
    higher transportation spending.</p>
    <p>In their study, Molloy, Garrick, and Atkinson-Palombo
    (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-molloy_new_2024-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>)
    look at CEX data after proposing a new framework to look at transit
    users and vehicle users. In past studies, three categories have been
    used to analyze transportation users: “drivers” are those who own a
    car, “captive riders” are those who use transit because they ca not
    afford a car, and “choice riders” are those who can afford a car but

    Molloy, Garrick, and Atkinson-Palombo
    (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-molloy_new_2024-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>)
    propose splitting that category into “captive drivers” and “choice
    drivers”. Captive drivers would be those in the population that are
    low income but have a car representing people with less
    transportation freedom. They analyzed the CEX with this new way of
    classifying transportation users and found that captive drivers
    carry the most transportation burden. The transportation
    expenditures of captive drivers average more than 16% of total
    household expenditures while the transportation expenditures of
    captive riders was only around 7% of total expenditures.</p>

    expenditures gettting much of their data from the CEX.</p>

    <title>2.4 The Current Study</title>
    <p>This study has never been done and will add to the current
    literature in the following ways.</p>
    <list list-type="bullet">
      <list-item>
        <p>Data: Many studies on household transportation patterns focus
        on time diaries and other things. This study uses consumer
        expenditure data to understand patterns in household
        transportation budgets.</p>
      </list-item>
      <list-item>
        <p>Methodology: LCA to find groupings that organize households
        using different transportation expense patterns. What variables
        do we want to look at, and how is that different from other
        studies?</p>
      </list-item>

  <title>3 Data</title>
  <p>Data for the following analysis were attained from the 2024
  Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX) Public Use Microdata (PUMD). The CEX
  is deployed continuously by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The
  data are organized by quarter published each year. The CEX consists of
  two surveys as described below.</p>
  <list list-type="bullet">
    <list-item>
      <p><bold>The Interview Survey</bold> tracks a household’s major
      and recurring expenditures by reviewing their expenses from the
      past three months. Approximatedly 6000 usable interviews are
      collected each quarter. After interviewing a household for 4
      consecutive quarters, they are removed from the sample and
      replaced by a new household.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p><bold>The Diary Survey</bold> tracks a household’s weekly
      expenditures by having them fill out a detailed expenditure diary
      across a two-week span. Approximately 3000 usable responses are
      collected each quarter. After the two consecutive weeks of
      reporting expenditures, the household is removed from the sample
      and replaced by a new household.</p>

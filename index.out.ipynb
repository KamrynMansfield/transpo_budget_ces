    "## 1 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Households juggle how to allocate their budgets: whether to invest in a reliable car, pay for quality childcare, secure housing in a good school district, or set money aside for leisure. These everyday choices shape how families live and move, reflecting the trade-offs they make to balance competing priorities. Transportation often sits at the center of these decisions, not only because it can be a significant expense, but also because choosing to buy and maintain a car versus relying on public transit represents a long-term commitment and a broader lifestyle choice. Its relative weight compared to housing, childcare, and other spending varies widely across families. The relationship between household budgeting and mobility is shaped not only by causal direction but also by how families prioritize and weight different needs. On one hand, mobility resources such as car ownership can structure the household budget: households with no or only one vehicle may spend far less on transportation, freeing up income for other essential or discretionary categories. On the other hand, underlying family structures and preferences can drive budget allocation choipces that, in turn, shape transportation behavior. Larger families may prioritize childcare or invest in higher-quality housing in areas with better schools, limiting what remains for transportation. Others may emphasize frugality across all categories or deliberately substitute toward lower-cost transit options. Understanding both the direction of influence and the weight assigned to different budget categories is critical for transportation planning and policy, as these dynamics reveal how families navigate competing priorities under varying demographic and mobility contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this research is to explore how household budgets are structured around transportation decisions and how this impacts other spending categories. Using the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX), we will perform a Latent Class Analysis (LCA) to find groupings based on a household’s transportation expenses. These groupings can help us find groups of spenders with similar patterns to help us predict transportation expenses based on the household’s characteristics.\n",

    "Table 1: Summary of the Literature\n",
    "\n",
    "The literature relating to this study has been classified into four groups: (1) Family Choices and Activity Patterns, (2) Family Transportation Choices, (3) Family Spending and Budgets, and (4) Family Transportation Budgets. The following sections describe the relevant findings from literature in each of these groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Family Choices and Activity Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "There have been many studies done on the choices and activities of families (see [Sener and Bhat 2007](#ref-sener_analysis_2007); [Rachel B. Copperman and Bhat 2007b](#ref-copperman_exploratory_2007); [Sener et al. 2008](#ref-sener_analysis_2008); [Leung et al. 2019](#ref-leung_environment-people_2019)). These studies often focus on the activities choices of households and children.\n",
    "\n",
    "Paleti, Copperman, and Bhat ([2011](#ref-paleti_empirical_2011)) performed a study where they wanted to characterize the activity patterns of children after school. Their data were gathered from the Child Development Supplement to the Panel Study of Income Dynamics which has household demographics and time-use diaries for children. They looked at travel patterns using combinations of three activity-travel scenarios: staying at school, going home from school, and going somewhere else after school. They further identified specific after-school activities (e.g. Organized activities at school, recreation at the home of someone else, meals at restaurants, etc.) to use in a multiple discrete-continuous extreme value (MDCEV) model. The MDCEV is a type of discrete choice model that works when multiple options can be chosen, and was used to find predictors of children’s participation in the different after school activities. In their analysis, they found that 57.7% of children in the survey participated in at least one out-of-home activity after school. They also found that children’s activities were connected to household income, family dynamics, environment, and other things. For example, children in households with higher income were more likely to participate in activities after school. Children with no siblings along with children having a working primary caregiver were more likely to stay at school or go somewhere besides home directly after school. Children living close to a large city were less likely to go somewhere after school, go home, and then go back out. The findings of this study show the variety of factors that might affect a family’s activity, and therefore transportation, patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another study on family choices was done by Bernardo et al. ([2015](#ref-bernardo_empirical_2015)). They used the American Time Use Survey and a Multiple Discrete Continuous Nested Extreme Value (MDCNEV) model to examine the activities of duel-earner households. The variables they used relate to household demographics, respondent demographics, couple characteristics, and day of the week. Findings indicated that women are more likely to participate in out-of-home maintenance, shopping, and social activities than men. They also found that respondents with higher education and with children are more likely to work from home. One key finding of this study is that couples with children are much less likely to participate in out-of-home, non-work activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Family Transportation Choices\n",
    "\n",
    "Among the studies on family choices is a group of studies that focus on family transportation choices ([Rachel B. Copperman and Bhat 2007a](#ref-copperman_analysis_2007); [Souche 2010](#ref-souche_measuring_2010); [Lu et al. 2022](#ref-lu_role_2022); [Amirnazmiafshar and Diana 2022](#ref-amirnazmiafshar_review_2022)). These studies look at the connection between family mobility and family decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "McCarthy et al. ([2017](#ref-mccarthy_factors_2017)) is a literature review with some good findings, but I don’t know if I should site the literature review or if I should find individual papers from the review to talk about.\n",
    "\n",
    "A unique study to understand the effects car ownership has on household decisions was done by Nicholas Klein ([2024](#ref-klein_subsidizing_2024)). In order to understand how access to a car can effect a family in the United States, he interviewed 30 people in Maryland and Virginia who received a subsidized car. Two main findings of this study relate to travel behavior changes and access to opportunities. The people interviewed generally changed their travel behavior in similar ways after receiving a car. Before receiving the car, they would rely on public transit and others for transportation, but after receiving a car, they made many trips in their own cars, including some trips that they had to forgo before having a car. Another general conclusion Klein makes is that people had more access to opportunities after receiving a car. They had easier access to more potential jobs, but some also mentioned the ability to get more hours at the their current jobs. With less reliance on public transit, many respondents spent more time with their families at the beginning and end of the day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another study interested in car ownership was done by @bilgin_investigating_2025. They analyzed car ownership across multiple years using the United Kingdom Household Longitudinal Study dataset to see if ridesourcing availability affects car ownership. They used two fixed effects logit models: one to model the effect of ridesourcing on the decision to increase the number of cars in the household and the other to model the effect of ridesourcing on the decision to decrease the number of cars in the household. Their results suggested that households with more than one car are more likely to get rid of a car and less likely to add a car compared to households with one car. Even with this tendency, their models did not show a strong connection between the presence of ride sourcing and changes in car ownership. They concluded that changes in household composition have a stronger impact on the change in number of cars of a household.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Family Spending and Budgets\n",
    "\n",
    "Another set of studies focuses on household budgets and household spending patterns ([Skinner 1985](#ref-skinner_variable_1985); [Nayga 1998](#ref-nayga_sample_1998); [Fontes and Fan 2006](#ref-fontes_effects_2006); [Sabelhaus et al. 2013](#ref-sabelhaus_is_2013)). Many of the studies reviewed had an emphasis on the budgets related to raising children. Hargunani, Vernekar, and Vernekar ([2024](#ref-hargunani_study_2024)) analyzed family spending patterns in Mumbai and concluded that many families focus their expenditures on the current and future wellbeing of their children. This is evidenced by money spent on basic necessities and setting aside money for the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has produced reports that use the CEX to specifically analyze the costs of raising a child in the United States. The most recent report ([Lino et al. 2017](#ref-lino_expenditures_2017)) found the top expenditure for married-couple families with two children to be housing. The rankings of other expenditures were different depending on the age of children, but food, child care/education, and transportation were always the next highest expenditures on children. Similar to the USDA report on the cost of raising children, Osborne, Wu, and Benson ([2021](#ref-osborne_updated_2021)) modeled the cost of raising children in Texas by following similar methodologies but using Texas-specific data for housing and childcare costs. They looked not only at married-couple families, but also at single-parent households and duel households where children spend time with both parents in different locations. They found differing expenditures on children among the different family make-ups and among different incomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other studies with similar analyses have had similar findings. @hastings_parental_2022 used the CEX to compare expenditures between different racial and ethnic groups. When controlling for both family characteristics and income, he found that there was not a significant difference in total expenditures on children among racial and ethnic groups. This suggests that income and family characteristics play a larger role in family budgeting than race and ethnicity. Duncan, Frank, and Guèvremont ([2023](#ref-duncan_estimating_2023)) performed a study in Canada using the country’s Survey of Household Spending (SHS) to analyze family expenditures. They found similar results as previously mentioned studies. Different income groups had different amounts allocated to children, but housing was always the highest expenditure with food, child care/education, and transportation being the next highest expenditures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4 Family Transportation Expenses and Budgets\n",
    "\n",
    "There have been many studies on family budgets and transportation expenses ([Morris and Wigan 1979](#ref-morris_family_1979); [Blumenberg 2003](#ref-blumenberg_transportation_2003); [Hong et al. 2005](#ref-hong_leisure_2005); [Thakuriah (Vonu) and Liao 2006](#ref-thakuriah_vonu_transportation_2006); [Choo, Lee, and Mokhtarian 2007](#ref-choo_transportation_2007); [Haas et al. 2008](#ref-haas_estimating_2008); [Ferdous et al. 2010](#ref-ferdous_comprehensive_2010)).\n",
    "\n",
    "One study focused on transportation budgets was done by Thakuriah and Liao ([2005](#ref-thakuriah_analysis_2005)). Using CEX data, they made multiple models to analyze the expenditures related to vehicle ownership of households in the United States. In each model, they used a variety of variables (income, household demographics, spatial factors, economic factors, and family condition factors) to predict the amount of money a household spends on vehicles. Their model results indicate 18 percent of additional household expenditures is a vehicle expense. They results also indicate many factors influence household vehicle expenses. The models showed that homeowners spend more on vehicle expenses. They also showed that vehicle expenses are connected with the sex of the head of household and the number of people in the household.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a study by Deka ([2015](#ref-deka_relationship_2015)), they used two years of the CEX to see the connection between housing expenses and transportation expenses. They created three least squares models: one to describe expenditures in dollar amounts, one to describe expenditures as percentages of income, and one to describe expenditures as shares of total household expenditures. They found a positive association between transportation expenses and housing expenses. Similarly, share of income on transportation was positively affected by share of income on housing, but there was no significant evidence showing the share of income on housing being affected by share of income on transportation. Both housing and transportation expenditures were found to be higher for those living in single-family detached homes and lower for those living in older homes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mattson ([2020](#ref-mattson_relationships_2020)) Mattson and Peterson ([2019](#ref-mattson_relationships_2019)) - single family homes spend more on transportation, higher income is correlated with higher transportation costs. - denser areas are more likely to use transit to commute. People in single-family homes tend to spend more money on transportation\n",
    "\n",
    "Mattson and Peterson ([2019](#ref-mattson_relationships_2019)) looked at how density, land use, transportation, and household expenditures are related. They developed a regression model using CEX data where transportation expenditures were estimated using type of housing, population, family characteristics, and other factors. Similar to other studies, they found that income is positively associated with transportation expenditures. Their model showed single-family homes to have higher transportation expenditures than other types of dwellings. Using data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Annual Survey of State and Local Government Finances, they also created models to explore how land use might affect municipal spending. In these models, increase in density was associated with a decrease in many per capita operational costs, including fire protection, streets and highways, parks and recreation, and others.\n",
    "\n",
    "A similar study was published by Mattson ([2020](#ref-mattson_relationships_2020)) where he modeled transportation expenditures using CEX data. The results showed, like the previous publication, that single-family dwellings spend more on transportation compared to other types. He also found that larger household sizes and newer homes contribute to higher transportation spending.\n",
    "\n",
    "Molloy, Garrick, and Atkinson-Palombo ([2024](#ref-molloy_new_2024)) - “Captive Riders” have less spending allocated to transportation than captive drivers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In their study, Molloy, Garrick, and Atkinson-Palombo ([2024](#ref-molloy_new_2024)) look at CEX data through after proposing new framework to look at transit users and vehicle users. In past studies, three categories have been used to analyze transportation users: “drivers” are those who own a car, “captive riders” are those who use transit because they ca not afford a car, and “choice riders” are those who can afford a car but do not. Instead of having one grouping for those that own cars, Molloy, Garrick, and Atkinson-Palombo ([2024](#ref-molloy_new_2024)) propose splitting that category into “captive drivers” and “choice drivers”. Captive drivers would be those in the population that are low income but have a car representing people with less transportation freedom. They analyzed the CEX with this new way of classifying transportation users and found that captive drivers carry the most transportation burden. The transportation expenditures of captive drivers average more than 16% of total household expenditures while the transportation expenditures of captive riders was only around 7% of total expenditures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bureau of Transportation Statistics ([2024](#ref-bureau_of_transportation_statistics_transportation_2024)) - Chapter 2 has a whole section where they analyze household expenditures gettting much of their data from the CEX.\n",

    "## 3 Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Data for the following analysis were attained from the 2024 Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX) Public Use Microdata (PUMD). The CEX is deployed continuously by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The data are organized by quarter published each year. The CEX consists of two surveys as described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **The Interview Survey** tracks a household’s major and recurring expenditures by reviewing their expenses from the past three months. Approximatedly 6000 usable interviews are collected each quarter. After interviewing a household for 4 consecutive quarters, they are removed from the sample and replaced by a new household.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **The Diary Survey** tracks a household’s weekly expenditures by having them fill out a detailed expenditure diary across a two-week span. Approximately 3000 usable responses are collected each quarter. After the two consecutive weeks of reporting expenditures, the household is removed from the sample and replaced by a new household.\n",
